# citizen-science

## Overview

This smart contract is part of the Decentralized Autonomous Climate Reserves (DACR) project. It implements a gamified citizen science system for crowdsourced ecosystem monitoring. Users can earn tokens for validating sensor data (e.g., geo-tagging healthy forests), with AI verification to prevent fraudulent submissions.

## Key Features

1. User Registration: Allows users to register as citizen scientists.
2. Observation Submission: Enables registered users to submit ecosystem observations.
3. AI Verification: Simulates AI verification of submitted observations (using OpenAI's CLIP in a real-world scenario).
4. Reward System: Distributes tokens to users for valid submissions.

## Contract Functions

### Public Functions

1. `register-citizen-scientist`: Allows a user to register as a citizen scientist.
2. `submit-observation`: Enables registered users to submit ecosystem observations.
3. `validate-observation`: Allows the contract owner to validate an observation (simulating AI verification).

### Read-Only Functions

1. `get-citizen-scientist`: Retrieves data for a specific citizen scientist.
2. `get-observation`: Retrieves data for a specific observation.
3. `get-total-rewards`: Gets the total rewards earned by a citizen scientist.

## Token System

The contract uses a fungible token called `citizen-science-token` to reward users for valid submissions.

## AI Verification

The contract includes a simulated AI verification function (`ai-verify`). In a real-world implementation, this would be replaced with a call to an oracle or off-chain AI service using OpenAI's CLIP or a similar model.

## Usage Flow

1. Users register as citizen scientists using `register-citizen-scientist`.
2. Registered users submit observations using `submit-observation`.
3. The contract owner (or an authorized entity) validates observations using `validate-observation`.
4. If an observation passes AI verification, the user is rewarded with tokens.

## Integration with DACR

This contract complements the Biome Tokenization feature by:

1. Providing a mechanism for real-time, crowdsourced data collection on ecosystem health.
2. Incentivizing user participation in conservation efforts.
3. Leveraging AI to ensure data quality and prevent fraudulent submissions.

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement a more sophisticated AI verification system using oracles or off-chain computation.
2. Add a reputation system for citizen scientists based on the quality and quantity of their observations.
3. Integrate with the Biome Tokenization contract to directly impact NFT values based on citizen science data.
4. Implement a governance system to allow community voting on observation validity and reward distribution.

## Security Considerations

- Only the contract owner can validate observations (simulating AI verification).
- Users must be registered to submit observations.
- Basic input validation is implemented to prevent invalid data submissions.
