# Decentralized-Autonomous-Climate-Reserves-DACR
# biome-tokenization smart contract

## Overview

The Biome Tokenization smart contract is a core component of the Decentralized Autonomous Climate Reserves (DACR) project. This contract implements a system for representing natural ecosystems (such as rainforests, coral reefs, etc.) as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with values tied to real-time biodiversity data collected from IoT sensors and satellite feeds.

Built using Clarity, a decidable smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain, this contract enables the creation, management, and valuation of digital assets that represent real-world natural ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **Ecosystem Representation**: Natural ecosystems are represented as unique NFTs with metadata including biome type, location, area size, and health score.
- **Dynamic Valuation**: NFT values are tied to real-time biodiversity data, appreciating when the ecosystem thrives and depreciating if it degrades.
- **Health Score Tracking**: The contract maintains a historical record of ecosystem health scores, enabling analysis of conservation efforts over time.
- **Authorized Data Sources**: Only verified data sources can update ecosystem health scores, ensuring data integrity.
- **SIP-009 Compliance**: The contract implements the SIP-009 NFT standard for compatibility with the broader Stacks ecosystem.

## Contract Structure

### Data Storage

- `token-metadata`: Stores detailed information about each biome token
- `token-uri`: Maps token IDs to URIs containing additional metadata
- `token-owner`: Tracks ownership of each token
- `health-history`: Records historical health scores with timestamps

### Key Functions

#### NFT Management

- `mint-biome`: Creates a new biome token with initial metadata
- `transfer`: Transfers ownership of a biome token
- `get-owner`: Returns the current owner of a token
- `get-token-uri`: Returns the URI for a token

#### Biome Health Management

- `update-health-score`: Updates the health score of a biome based on IoT/satellite data
- `get-biome-metadata`: Returns all metadata for a specific biome
- `get-health-at-time`: Returns the health score at a specific point in time
- `calculate-biome-value`: Calculates the current value of a biome based on its health score and other factors

#### Data Source Management

- `add-authorized-data-source`: Adds a new authorized data source
- `remove-authorized-data-source`: Removes an authorized data source
- `is-authorized-data-source`: Checks if a principal is an authorized data source

## Integration with DACR

This contract serves as the foundation for the DACR ecosystem by:

1. **Providing Digital Representation**: Creating digital twins of natural ecosystems that can be monitored and valued
2. **Enabling Transparent Valuation**: Establishing a clear link between ecosystem health and economic value
3. **Supporting Conservation Incentives**: Creating a mechanism where conservation efforts directly impact token value
4. **Facilitating Investment**: Allowing stakeholders to invest in conservation through ownership of biome tokens

## Usage Flow

1. **Biome Registration**: Conservation organizations or DAOs register natural ecosystems by minting biome tokens
2. **Data Integration**: Authorized IoT devices and satellite data providers update ecosystem health scores
3. **Valuation**: The contract automatically calculates biome values based on health scores and other factors
4. **Conservation Incentives**: As ecosystem health improves, token values increase, rewarding conservation efforts

## Future Enhancements

- **Carbon Credit Integration**: Link biome tokens to carbon credit generation
- **Parametric Insurance**: Implement insurance mechanisms that trigger based on ecosystem health thresholds
- **Governance Integration**: Connect with DAO governance for community-driven conservation decisions
- **Marketplace Integration**: Enable trading of biome tokens on decentralized marketplaces

## Technical Requirements

- Stacks blockchain node
- Clarity smart contract deployment tools
- Oracle integration for IoT and satellite data feeds

## Security Considerations

- Only the contract owner can mint new biome tokens
- Only authorized data sources can update health scores
- Health scores are constrained to values between 0 and 100
- Historical health data is immutably recorded on-chain
